Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. 

Data Preparation 

Before applying any machine learning technique, data preparation is crucial.

In weather forecasting, data preparation involves cleaning the data, removing outliers, and handling missing values.

Data normalization may also be necessary to ensure that all variables are on the same scale

Data Pre-Processing:

The column weather contains the data value in the string form and we need to predict the weather data so for that we need to process the data.

We can observe that wind and preception are weakly co-related.temp_max and wind are negatively correlated means they move in the opposite direction.
